    <h2>At what point should the artist cede credit to the machine?</h2>
    <div id="container">
    	<div class="column" id="questionColumn">
            <p>First, let's define how AI-generated art is created.</p>
            <p>AI algorithms draw on large volumes of data sets in order to perform a task. In our earlier example of a portrait, developers taught their AI which pictures wer "liked" and "dislike". Based on these preferences, the AI develops an image closer to what the "liked" images resemble. The program is learning from the data they are fed, rather than just following a strict order of rules.</p>
            <p>We may wonder why we feel ceding credit to a machine is different than ceding credit to our paintbrushes? Perhaps because humans create art by physically interacting with the medium of their choice. However, with AI-generated art, the final piece is assembled by the machine, without any human touch.</p>
            <p>Going back to our original question, some argue that developers of the AI algorithm should receive credit. They've created the program, selected the data, envisioned a possible outcome. Additionally, the developer may be involved in pre- and post-curation, tweaking the algorithm to result in desired ouputs.</p>
            <p>But when the algorithm stops relying on the test data and start learning from its own creations, does its creation then become a product of the AI itself? If so, shouldn't the machine receive credit for its creation?</p>
