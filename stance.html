    <h2>Our Stance</h2>
    <div id="container">
      <h4>Throughout our research, we have established our own collective stance on the presented questions.</h4>
    	<div class="column" id="questionColumn">
            <h4>Can AI produce authentic art? </h4>
            <p>We believe it can. AI is capable of producing art that is unique and desired based on past examples and various experiences. The necessitation of specifically "human" experiences is arbitrary, and it is clear that with this criterion removed, there is no creative difference between AI and human. Further, we believe that with current technology, AI-generated art can be appreciated within its own context. By this we mean that in the same way it is unfair to compare Travis Scott and Pablo Picasso, we feel AI produced art should be given its own contextual sphere.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Does the machine/algorithm deserve any credit?</h4>
            <p>Right now, AI algorithms do deserve recognition in their role in the creation of art. While the developer teaches the AI what to produce based on specified preferences, the AI physically creates the art itself. However, in the future we envision a time when AI will be able to fully produce content on its own and will be able to learn from more than just what the developer inputs.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Will AI take our artistic and creative jobs?</h4>
            <p>We believe as long as humans find ways to work with AI, their jobs in creative industries will remain. AI can serve as a powerful tool, similar to the ones that already exist, and will hopefully push humans to create in a new and different way.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
            <p>The goal of this project was to present research and answer questions stemming from the discussion of human authenticity versus that of AI. We are intrigued by this topic because of its growing presence in our world. We focused on physical art, such as Obvious's AI-generated portrait, however we realize that AI is able to produce deeper and better content. From our research we found an AI algorithm was able to produce a new song based on a dataset of Travis Scott songs and another algorithm was able to replicate Joe Rogan's voice based on his thousands of podcast episodes. As potentially malicious machine learning content becomes prevalent in our world, we feel everyone should be aware not only of what artificial intelligence generated content is and how it is made. It seems to most people that creativity is what makes humans unique, but our project aims to show that AI is also able to create in a similar way. We hope our project and the questions we ponder encourages the reader to form their own opinion on AI-generated art due to its inevitable rise in the creative space. </p>
